# jekyll-footnote-id-plugin
Very simply Jekyll plugin to make unique Markdown footnote references. I built this to automatically generate unique IDs, so some of the really nice footnote plugins wouldn't choke when generic footnote references were used on a collection page.

More details on it on [my site](https://ryantoohil.com/2017/07/building-a-jekyll-plugin.html).

This is the very basic version (just drop it into _plugins). I'll eventually turn it into a real plugin.
